# Myles-Portfolio-Projects
A collection of projects I have worked on, organized into folders.
These folders are extracted from larger sandbox projects that contain projects I did not contribute to. 
I have extracted my work and put them into subfolders so my work can be viewed. 

These projects will not launch in this state. To address this limitation I have included APKs for Kreis Immersive and 
a weblink to Aftermath Islands live servers.
