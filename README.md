# Myles-Portfolio-Projects
A collection of projects I have worked on, organized into folders.
These folders are extracted from larger sandbox projects that contain projects I did not contribute to. 
I have extracted my work and put them into subfolders so my work can be viewed. 

These projects will not launch in this state. To address this limitation I have included Server and Client Builds for Kreis Immersive
and a weblink to Aftermath Islands live servers. 

****SHAKESPEAR IN THE METAVERSE****

For Shakespear in the metaverse I have included the server and client builds so that this level of the game can be tested reliably. 
If I was to include the entire APK of the game it may not launch. The servers of Kreis Immersive may not always be available.
This is a PC VR application so you will need to use Air Link or a Link Cable.
To launch this experience go to folder Shakespeare In The Metaverse -> SIM Dinning Room Level Server Build -> Podium.exe 
Next open Shakespeare In The Metaverse -> Sim Dinnig Room Client Build -> Podium.exe 
This will launch this level of the experience.

****BOSS INFO TRAINING WORKSPACE****

For the Boss Info Training Workspace application I have included a client APK the server for this application will remain live on AWS.
This is a standalone application so you will need to run the APK from your Quest HMD.
