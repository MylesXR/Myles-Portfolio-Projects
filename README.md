MYLES-PORTFOLIO-PROJECTS

A collection of projects I have worked on, organized into folders.

These folders are extracted from larger sandbox projects that contain projects I did not contribute to.

I have extracted my work and put them into subfolders so my work can be viewed here in github.

These projects will not launch in unity but there are playable demos included if you download the repo.

I have included server and client builds for Kreis Immersive projects.

SHAKESPEARE IN THE METAVERSE


For Shakespeare in the metaverse, I have included the server and client builds so that this level of the game can be tested reliably.

This is a PC VR application, so you will need to use Air Link or a Link Cable with your HMD.

To launch this experience, go to folder Shakespeare In The Metaverse -> SIM Dining Room Level Server Build -> Podium.exe

Next, open Shakespeare In The Metaverse -> Sim Dining Room Client Build -> Podium.exe 

This will launch the multiplayer demo.

BOSS INFO TRAINING WORKSPACE

For the Boss Info Training Workspace application, I have included a client APK. The server for this application will remain live on AWS.

This is a standalone application, so you will need to run the APK from your HMD.

This demo is on a testing server so you will not interfere with any workplace training that could be taking place.
